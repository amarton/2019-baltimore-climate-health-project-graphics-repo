 Heat index is a value measuring apparent temperature, how hot it actually feels to the human body. Air temperature and relative humidity are used to calculate heat index. With little humidity, the temperature the body feels isn't much different from the air temperature. But as temperatures rise, even small amounts of humidity can pose a threat and increase the likelihood of heat disorders and illnesses.</div><br>
